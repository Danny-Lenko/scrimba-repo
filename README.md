## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS utility classes


### What I learned

1) the Utility Classes "gap" property to use between flex and grid elements (html customizable variable)

```css
.flex {
   display: flex;
   gap: var(--gap, 1.6rem);
}
.grid {
   display: grid;
   gap: var(--gap, 1.6rem);
}
```

### Continued development

* CSS grid;

*Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Grid Attack](https://codingfantasy.com) - This helped me practice CSS GRID. Challenging and interactive game aimed at learning the css grid properties' application.

- [Git + GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk) - the basic git commands (Youtube).
- [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - for more help with writing markdown (Article).
